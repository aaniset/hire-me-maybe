    "body": "Hello everyone Please read this announcement in its entirety As you might be aware already we permit resubmissions of your report if you have any mistakesshortcomings on your first submission However we have noticed that a lot of students fail to make the required resubmission in a reasonable time frame As such we have decided to more strictly enforce our resubmission rule Start today you will have exactly two weeks to make any resubmissions This is regardless of when your report is graded For example for the week of June 10 to June 16 you will have until June 30 to make any resubmissions After June 30th we will close off the assignment and no more resubmissions will be allowed for any reason At that point if you have a score less than 10 it will count as an invalid report and will count as unemployment This will give you enough time read through grading comments and make any changes required The earlier you have the resubmission the more time you will have to correct your report if there are still any comments After the first grading cycle it will be your responsibility to come to office hours and get it regraded As a side note if you are unable to make submissions on the epicsprocom website due to a technical issue please email your issue with screenshots to In the meantime you are still responsible for your report so please manually write your report and make sure you are still submitting it before the deadline to avoid late submission penalties Please come to office hours on Thursday if you have any questions Best Omkaar Shenoy ProEPICS Staff View announcement Update your notification settings",

moved to Arizona in 2019 for the start of my freshman year at the ASU Polytechnic campus I originally joined ASU as an engineering major with a focus in robotics and as a part of Barrett The Honors College but added on the manufacturing degree as a second major in my sophomore year I began the Accelerated Masters program my senior year in the manufacturing program and finished with my masters this last semester spring 2024 My sophomore year I got involved with the 3DX additive manufacturing research group under Dr Dhruv Bhate through an honors contract I did with him for his EGR218 Materials and Manufacturing Processes course In Dr Bhates group I was able to work on a variety of projects such as multimaterial mechanical structures and metal additive wicking structures I have also been given the chance to become proficient in SEM imaging techniques 3D scanning and various additive manufacturing processes Later on I was given the opportunity to also work alongside Dr Niris group for my masters applied project and gain experience in acoustic NDT techniques Currently I am working at Northrop Grumman in Gilbert Arizona where I also interned while attending ASU I currently work in the specialty engineering group as a systems engineer doing electrical radiation analysis and simulation I was lucky enough to land this internship which has transitioned into a fulltime position through my connections in the SCALE program a program based out of Purdue University to expand defenserelated microelectronics work I was introduced to this program via a class I took with Dr Bhate which was an introductory course to microelectronics manufacturing and design Further reading ASU graduate impacts manufacturing engineering research From pizza pies to power plays The rise of

    "body": "Hello everyone Please read this announcement in its entirety As you might be aware already we permit resubmissions of your report if you have any mistakesshortcomings on your first submission However we have noticed that a lot of students fail to make the required resubmission in a reasonable time frame As such we have decided to more strictly enforce our resubmission rule Start today you will have exactly two weeks to make any resubmissions This is regardless of when your report is graded For example for the week of June 10 to June 16 you will have until June 30 to make any resubmissions After June 30th we will close off the assignment and no more resubmissions will be allowed for any reason At that point if you have a score less than 10 it will count as an invalid report and will count as unemployment This will give you enough time read through grading comments and make any changes required The earlier you have the resubmission the more time you will have to correct your report if there are still any comments After the first grading cycle it will be your responsibility to come to office hours and get it regraded As a side note if you are unable to make submissions on the epicsprocom website due to a technical issue please email your issue with screenshots to In the meantime you are still responsible for your report so please manually write your report and make sure you are still submitting it before the deadline to avoid late submission penalties Please come to office hours on Thursday if you have any questions Best Omkaar Shenoy ProEPICS Staff View announcement Update your notification settings",

moved to Arizona in 2019 for the start of my freshman year at the ASU Polytechnic campus I originally joined ASU as an engineering major with a focus in robotics and as a part of Barrett The Honors College but added on the manufacturing degree as a second major in my sophomore year I began the Accelerated Masters program my senior year in the manufacturing program and finished with my masters this last semester spring 2024 My sophomore year I got involved with the 3DX additive manufacturing research group under Dr Dhruv Bhate through an honors contract I did with him for his EGR218 Materials and Manufacturing Processes course In Dr Bhates group I was able to work on a variety of projects such as multimaterial mechanical structures and metal additive wicking structures I have also been given the chance to become proficient in SEM imaging techniques 3D scanning and various additive manufacturing processes Later on I was given the opportunity to also work alongside Dr Niris group for my masters applied project and gain experience in acoustic NDT techniques Currently I am working at Northrop Grumman in Gilbert Arizona where I also interned while attending ASU I currently work in the specialty engineering group as a systems engineer doing electrical radiation analysis and simulation I was lucky enough to land this internship which has transitioned into a fulltime position through my connections in the SCALE program a program based out of Purdue University to expand defenserelated microelectronics work I was introduced to this program via a class I took with Dr Bhate which was an introductory course to microelectronics manufacturing and design Further reading ASU graduate impacts manufacturing engineering research From pizza pies to power plays The rise of
