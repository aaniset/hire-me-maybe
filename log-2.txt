electrical engineering I landed in the United States of America from India on Dec 20 2020 to pursue my masters degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State University Before the graduate journey I earned my bachelors degree in engineering followed by working in the industry for a couple of years to gain some valuable professional experience I would any day say the best part of the entire academic journey happened for me in Tempe Arizona Though it was loaded with challenges from finding accommodation to cooking meals and not forgetting the rigorous coursework packed with assignments and exams I enjoyed every part as it pushed my limits towards a better future As I progressed through the first semester I got selected to serve as a graduate teaching assistant for which I am always grateful as it gave me the chance to engage in tutoring the lab assignments for over 60 students at the senior level That experience helped me sharpen my problem solving and peoplemanagement skills In the graduate program I published five technical papers in reputed journals which I am quite proud of The coursework and lab sessions were so structured and aligned with industry expectations that I landed an internship for seven months with Intel Corporation as a graduate technical intern within my first six months at the university It was a dream come true to be working for a semiconductor giant and learning machine learning methods targeted towards driving the best silicon products for the world’s computing requirements Currently I work as a silicon design engineer with one of the leading semiconductor companies in the world helping them drive Power Performance Area PPA and cost through Design Technology and Concurrent Optimization DTCO using leadingedge technologies such as 2nm 3nm and beyond for the products ranging from laptops to the current buzz word artificial intelligence compute Though my efforts played a role in the process I owe a lot to the ASU where I gained the technical acumen that is supporting my career growth currently I enjoy traveling and experiencing nature at its finest As of now I have covered 22 US states and am continuing to explore as much as possible ASU launching Doctor of Information Technology degree program in fall 2024 Starting in fall 2024 a new professional doctorate degree program will be offered

BS in engineering robotics 24 MS in manufacturing engineering As a child I would ask my parents “Why did you name me Matthew” My father would jokingly say that he named me Matthew D’Souza for my initials to be MD the same initials as a Doctor of Medicine Initially I was okay with this prediction I love helping others Yet my decision to become a doctor changed the day I watched a certain medical program I don’t remember the specifics of the show only that they were performing a heart transplant on a young girl who was suffering The intensity of the operation combined with the suffering of the individual implanted a fear of surgery which led me to turn away from directly pursuing medicine However I remember watching another show within that same time about underwater biology While the biology aspect did not speak to me the robots being built and tested to explore underwater caverns to collect data and information did I was enraptured by that single moment and it led me to pursue engineering Entering Arizona State University was an interesting period of my life I was the first person in my family to attend college I had no personal guidance on what to take and what areas to focus on I learned through trial and error Other than going through the standard firstyear experience of learning how to set a schedule to balance school and wellbeing I also had to learn how to maximize my time to ensure I was getting the most out of college I got to attend a variety of different fun and informative events not only hosted by the school but also the various clubs and organizations under it — from going ice skating for the first time in my life to riding in a pace car around a NASCAR track After a while I got into the routine of what to do and figured out where I needed to go to ask for help However that is when I encountered one of my largest obstacles the pandemic It took me a while to regain my bearings but I managed to recover and overcome the challenges that I faced during that time During my academic career at ASU I had the opportunity to experience a variety of opportunities and join various clubs I was able to design and build circuit boards in EGR 304314 Embedded Systems Design and learn about the automotive industry through Sun Devil Racing Polytechnic I even had the opportunity to contribute to collecting data research in Dr Dhruv Bhate’s lab I also helped acquire new equipment for the university that will help fundamentally shape future projects related to 3D scanning Being a part of ASU allowed me to experience opportunities that I had never encountered I explored engineering topics but also topics outside this focus which allowed me to be a more wellrounded person Since graduating in May I have been developing my engineering skills through personal projects I am on the hunt for a job that I can direct my skills and passion into where I can research and develop for example semiconductor manufacturing I find the implementation of consistent improvements for processes and chip design attractive I love that the semiconductor industry encompasses everything from the field of military development to improvements in the field of medical research and advancements This field allows for a wide array of engineering possibilities I am excited to be an ASU alumnus and continue on this engineering and research
